- Teecherz Home & Office Furnishers
- Furniture categories (Dining, Living, Bedroom, Office)
- Zimbabwe-based business context
- Services: Free delivery, returns, multiple payment options

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Screenshots)

Once screenshots are provided, we will:
1. Analyze the actual website structure
2. Match sections to Lanima-inspired components
3. Replace placeholder content with actual content
4. Refine design to match Lanima patterns exactly
5. Add any missing sections
6. Implement proper images and assets

## 📝 Notes

- Navigation links are placeholders and will be updated based on actual site structure
- Product data is placeholder and will be replaced with actual products
- Images are currently placeholders and will need to be added
